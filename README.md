# Project Title: Enhancing ML Performance Through Class Imbalance Solutions
### In this project, I have implemented various class imbalance techniques on different imbalanced datasets from Kaggle and compared the performance of each technique. Initially, I ran baseline executions before applying these techniques and then evaluated the results after application.
### The classification models used in this project include:
